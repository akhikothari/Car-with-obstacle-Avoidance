This was my 3rd Year College Project in which I used Arduino Micrcocontroller for making an "BLUETOOTH CONTROL OBSTACLE AVODIANCE, HIGH LOW
BEAM ROBOT CAR" where I use various peripherals like bluetooth module HC-05,L293D motor driver, Ultrasonic Sensor and GPS for implementing
various features we could introduce to modern automobile industry. All peripherals are assembled and implemented at software level and Hardware
level.
